This Foundry VTT Adventure is intended to be free to use.

The Island of Adventure is a place for adventure based on my own D&D campaign centered around the D&D module series B - The search for adventure.

It is an adventure with no levels set for the NPCs, so the DM can determine as they see fit what challenge they want to set the party. There is a DnD5e version also available.

I found the initial hex size too small for my liking so I expanded it to give a 3 mile per hex map

The adventure portraits, tokens, text and maps have been produced by Tom McCafferty using Paint Dot Net, Dungeondraft, Unreal Engine and DR free snapshots which allow commercial use of content created with them. Some Roll tables have been provided by http://dndspeak.com

This module contains...

15 x Actors, 3 x Journal Entries, 11 x Scenes, 15 Folders and 53 x Rollable Tables

Some references have been made to the Foundry VTT Shadowdark Edition Game System but no art work or tokens are included. These artwork file references have been included in the packaging of the adventure to indicate the monsters and items the DM should use.
